# Data-forecasting-of-E-Commerce-in-United-States
This project will show what is the overall trend in the United States marketplace. It will give us a clear understanding if it will be beneficial in the future and will people continue to buy from E-commerce.

We performed a time-series analysis on the data with respect to the weekly sales of E-Commerce in the United States. Predicting E-Commerce sales will help us predict whether there will be any benefit of shifting offline business to online.

We did two separate analysis on the data.

Analysis I - Forecast accuracy comparison pre-covid To find the predicted value in an ideal case scenario for the Ecommerce profits by considering the pre covid data. Split the dataset into training and testing to calculate accuracy as per different methods.

Analysis II - Difference between saleâ€™s profit for Covid and non Covid period Forecasted the data for the next 3 months by considering pre covid period and calculated the difference of the actual profit made as compared to our predictions.

Our dataset consists of 73 rows and 3 variable columns. It is the one year sales data of E-Commerce for every product. We predicted the sales of the product in this project and determined if it will be profitable or not.

Got data from a very popular site Kaggle ( URL: https://www.kaggle.com/ ). There are a huge amount of data sets available for various other fields. We have 4 columns of data explained as follows.

Order date: This is a date format data, the date on which order was placed
Category: Different categories of items ordered through E-Commerce
Profit updated: It represents profit of the E commerce website of a company on a weekly basis.
