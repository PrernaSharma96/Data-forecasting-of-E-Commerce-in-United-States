# Forecasting-of-E-Commerce-Products
This project will showcase the overall trend in the United States marketplace regarding various products. Using the past values we will be forecasting the future sales' profit.
It will give us a clear understanding if it will be beneficial in the future and will people continue to buy from E-commerce.

We are going to perform time-series analysis on the data with respect to the weekly sales of E-Commerce in the United States. Predicting E-Commerce sales will help us predict whether there will be any benefit of shifting offline business to online.

We will be dividing the dataset in a 4:1 ratio, where we will be using the first part for forecasting the data and the other part (20% of the dataset) will be used to check the accuracy of the forecasted data. We will also be forecasting 20 data points from the future where the actual data is not available.

The accuracy of the forecast can be measured by using methods that determine the forecasting errors. We will be using MAD, MSE, and MAPE methods on our dataset in order to check the accuracy of our forecast.

Our dataset consists of 73 rows and 4 variable columns. It is the one-year sales data of E-Commerce for every product. We will predict the sales of the product in this project and determine if it will be profitable or not.

Received data from a very popular site Kaggle ( URL: https://www.kaggle.com/ ). There are a huge amount of data sets available for various other fields. We have 4 columns of data explained as follows.

- Order date: This is a date format data, the date on which order was placed
- Manage ID: It is an ID unique for every row
- State: Different states within the United States ordered through E-Commerce
- Category: Different categories of items ordered through E-Commerce
